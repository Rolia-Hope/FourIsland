# FourIsland
A 100% Idle game about egg hatching with insane probabilities


Here're the goals and ideas : 

## Base Game concept : 

- You have an empty team
- With the shelter it fills you eggs as soon as a spot is empty. Rarity of eggs are a thing and a timer is set to recharge an available egg. Not stackable.
- When an egg is hatched it's saved to the PC with all the stats. It's like your showroom, no real other use
- When hatching, an egg will give some currency that will be useful for the shop AND a probability for a candy that can be used to evolve a Pokemon
- You have the daycare, you can put two compatible Pokemon to generate egg of THAT species. The goal is that putting specific mon will help to breed specific traits (Two Alpha would give a HUGE boost of hatching Alpha etc)
- The daycare will stack eggs, you'll be able to upgrade it to boost the amount of eggs stored and the speed of it. That way as soon as you hatch a egg, another one is taken to fill your team
- You have account upgrade (infinite, no prestige) that will help to setup your account : For example you start by being able to hatch 50 eggs / hours, then with some upgrades you'll be able to hatch 10k eggs / hour
- A Pokedex section to see exactly what kind of sprites / pokemon you hatched, and maybe the amount
- A filter page. When you'll have a decent account you'll need to use filters in order to avoid to fill your PC with random mons. You'll be able to configure multiple filters (like keep all the Shiny or keep all the alpha with THESE IVs)


## Rarity Criterias : 

- Gender
- Nature
- IVs
- Shiny (Star / Square)
- Alpha
- Retro (Retro sprite + Some new / customs to see for more challenge for recent mons)

For example (not set on some numbers), getting a Shiny Alpha Gold Modest Bulbasaur would be : 
- 1/8192 (shiny) * 1/25 (nature) * 1/100 (Alpha) * 1/4500 (Gold Sprite) = 1/92 160 000 000
So the idea is to have a decent account to help boost your probabilities. Let's say you have in the daycare two Regular Modest Alpha Gold Bulbasaur :
- 1/8192 (shiny) * 1 (nature) * 1/10 (Alpha) * 1/450 (Gold sprite) = 1/36 864 000
Then your account stats will help (hatching 100k eggs / hour will be better than 10 eggs / hour)
- Shop upgrades + items (Hatching faster, egg in the daycare / shelter generating faster, more PC boxes)
- Breeding would allow some gene boost (Alpha, natures, IVs, Retro sprite. Shiny should be but maybe keeping it as the base challenge)
